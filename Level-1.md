# Task 2 - Asynchronous

- Asynchronous JavaScript allows non-blocking code execution, crucial for managing tasks like data fetching and API calls without halting program flow.
- The program implements a callback-based approach to simulate cooking instructions for a food recipe, with each step represented by a function.
- Each step function invokes the next step via a callback upon completion, ensuring sequential execution and reflecting real-world cooking scenarios.
- Utilizing callbacks maintains a structured flow, enabling the recipe to progress asynchronously while allowing other operations to proceed concurrently, enhancing performance and user experience.
- Asynchronous programming with callbacks is essential in JavaScript development for creating responsive and efficient applications, vital for tasks such as user interactions and server communication.

# Task 3 - Promises

- **Clearer Code Structure:** Promises provide a cleaner and more readable code structure compared to callback-based approaches, making it easier to understand the flow of asynchronous operations.

- **Error Handling:** Promises offer built-in error handling through the use of `.catch()`, allowing developers to handle errors more effectively and ensure smooth execution of the program.

- **Chaining and Sequencing:** Promises enable chaining of asynchronous operations using `.then()`, simplifying the sequential execution of tasks and reducing callback nesting.

- **Asynchronous Parallelism:** Promises allow for parallel execution of asynchronous tasks using `Promise.all()` or `Promise.race()`, enhancing performance by running multiple tasks concurrently when applicable.

# Task 5 - VI

**VI: Navigating the Depths of Text Editing**

> - In the vast ocean of text editors, VI stands as a beacon of *efficiency* and *reliability*, tracing its roots back to the dawn of Unix systems.
> - Its minimalist interface belies a powerhouse of functionality, offering a plethora of commands and shortcuts designed to streamline text editing tasks.
> - VI's modal editing paradigm, where users seamlessly transition between *insert* and *command* modes, epitomizes its user-centric design philosophy.
> - Customization is key in VI's realm, empowering users to mold the editor to their unique needs through *settings*, *macros*, and *plugins*.
> - Yet, mastering VI is an odyssey in itself, a journey of discovery that rewards persistence with unparalleled speed and precision in text manipulation.
> - In the ever-evolving landscape of text editors, VI remains a *steadfast companion*, a testament to the enduring legacy of **simplicity**, **efficiency**, and timeless **elegance**.

### Features:

This is a sample Markdown file created using VI. Below are some key features illustrated:

1. **Opening a File:**
* ```vi <file-name>.<extension>```
* Example : `vi trial.txt`.

2. **Switching Modes:**
* Press `i` to enter insert mode (where you can type text).
* Press `Esc` to return to normal mode (for navigation and commands).

3. **Saving and Exiting:**
* To save changes and exit, press `Esc` to ensure you're in normal mode, the type `:wq` and press `Enter`.
* To exit without saving changes, press `Esc`, then type `:q!` and press `Enter`.

4. **Navigation:**
* Use arrow keys or `h`,`j`,`k`,`l` for left, down, up and right respectively.
* To move to the beginning of a line, press `0`.
* To move to the end of a line, press `$`.

5. **Editing:**
* Press `x` to delete the character under the cursor.
* Press `dd` to delete the entire line.
* Press `yy` to copy the entire line.

6. **Undo / Redo:**
* To undo changes, press `u` in normal mode.
* To redo changes, press `Ctrl + r` in normal mode.

7. **Searching:**
* Press `/` followed by the text to search for it.
* Press `n` to find the next occurence, or `N` to find the previous occurence.
