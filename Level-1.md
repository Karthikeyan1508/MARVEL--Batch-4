# Task 12 : Soldering Prerequisites

Soldering is a process used for joining metal parts to form a mechanical or electrical bond. It typically uses a low melting point metal alloy (solder) which is melted and applied to the metal parts to be joined and this bonds to the metal parts and forms a connection when the solder solidifies.
