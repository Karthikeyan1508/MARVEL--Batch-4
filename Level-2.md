# Task 1 - OSI

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and describe the functions of a networking or telecommunication system. It was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to standardize the protocols used in various layers of network communication. The model is divided into seven layers, each responsible for specific functions in the process of data transmission between devices across a network.

| Layer No | Layer Name          | Responsibility                                                     | Information Form(Data Unit) | Device or Protocol |
|----------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|
| 7        | Application Layer   | Helps in identifying the client and synchronizing communication.  | Message                      | SMTP               |
| 6        | Presentation Layer  | Data from the application layer is extracted and manipulated in the required format for transmission. | Message | JPEG, MPEG, GIF |
| 5        | Session Layer       | Establishes Connection, Maintenance, Ensures Authentication and Ensures security. | Message | Gateway |
| 4        | Transport Layer     | Take Service from Network Layer and provide it to the Application Layer. | Segment | Firewall |
| 3        | Network Layer       | Transmission of data from one host to another, located in different networks. | Packet | Router |
| 2        | Data Link Layer     | Node to Node Delivery of Message.                                  | Frame | Switch, Bridge |
| 1        | Physical Layer      | Establishing Physical Connections between Devices.                 | Bits | Hub, Repeater, Modem, Cables |

# Task 4 - Make a Web app

I completed the task of creating a resource library website using Express, enabling users to browse available resource articles, books, and other materials. The website features functionalities for viewing detailed information about each resource and includes a search option to help users find specific content. The project also involved setting up a system for managing the resources, where administrators can add, edit, and delete entries as needed. This functionality ensures that the library's content remains current and comprehensive, providing a valuable tool for users to access and explore a wide range of materials.

To build this project, I extensively utilized MDN documentation, which provided crucial insights and guidance on using Express and related web development technologies. The documentation was instrumental in understanding and implementing best practices for building a robust and efficient web application. The project not only helped in honing my technical skills in using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB but also provided a deeper understanding of web development concepts such as routing, middleware, and data management. This experience has been enriching, contributing to my proficiency in developing dynamic and user-friendly web applications.
